Evaluating Nonlinear dimensional reduction algorithms by testing the following:
-Approximating the input data distribution by finding low dimensional manifold representations of input data
-Trying to infer labels of unlabelled data points of the manifold 
-Visualizing 2D manifolds for qualitative analysis of the input data
